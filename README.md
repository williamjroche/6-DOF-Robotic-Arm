# 6-DOF-Robotic-Arm
Class project for Kinematics and Control of Robotic Systems
Created by: William Roche, Benjamin Sedmont, Alexander Streck

Robot:

  - Uses miniconda python environment running robotics tool box by Peter Corke
- Arduino file used to send joint angle commmands to the robot
- A report on how the robot works, the materials, and references used
